								<h2 class="major">Motivation</h2>
								<p>Our goals for this project are to explore how different machine learning techniques such as time series analysis, ensemble methods, recurrent nueral networks, and various grouping techniques can be used to create meaningful predictions for temperate change on worldwide, regional, and other groupings levels. We are hoping to provide statistically significant results on temperature change with the additional data we found on climate footprints to be able to meaningfully validate our results and provide interesting groupings of alike countries for analysis.</p>
								<h3>Machine Learning Techniques Utilized:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Time Series Analysis</li>
									<li>K-Means Clustering</li>
									<li>Hierarchical Clustering</li>
									<li>Ensemble Methods</li>
									<li>Recurrent Neural Networks</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Datasets:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><a href="https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/ET">FAOSTAT Dataset</a></li>
									<p>This dataset is from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, and it contains yearly overall temperature change data and temperature standard deviation for every country. For every country (with the exception of a few where data was not collected), there is data from the years of 1961 to 2023 with the change in average temperature and standard deviation compared to the baseline for that country from the years 1951-1980. This data is also separated by month and seasons, making it applicable to compare how climate change has affected the average temperature in different months/seasons.</p>
									<li><a href="https://data.world/makeovermonday/2018w17-ecological-footprint-per-capita">NFA Dataset</a></li>
									<p>This dataset is from the National Footprints Accounts which is a dataset provided by the United Nations, culminating data from the Food and Agriculture Organization, United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database, and the UN Statistics Division, as well as the International Energy Agency. This dataset features information on most countries to measure the ecological resource use and resource capacity of nations spanning from 1961-2014, given that data was recorded in each of these nations for this entire range of years. This dataset takes various climate information into account, such as carbon emission, fishery & aquaculture, and livestock products, in order to produce an ecological footprint measurement and footprint rating for each year in each nation. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Analysis</h2>
								<p>In our early data exploration, we focused on visualizing both datasets to determine how to best move forward in model creation.</p>
								<h3>FAOSTAT EDA:</h3>
								<p>Looking at the FAOSTAT dataset, we visualized the data in numerous ways including simply ploting temperature change by month and year to gauge trends, and by checking for correlation between months and temperature change to see if there were certain months that might contribute more to our models. Below are two plots from this analysis.</p>

								<img src="website_template/images/FAOSTAT_EDA_2.png" alt = "Correlation month to temp change" width="550" height="auto">
								<h3>NFA EDA:</h3>
								<p>Looking at the NFA dataset, we visualized the distributions of various numerical variables in the data.This initial EDA helped us see that this data set might not provide the same amount of information for every country so it should be used in a more supplementary way. Moving forward we thought it would be a good idea to use this data set to create clusters since we could group countries based on similarity in their land use.</p>

								<img src="website_template/images/NFA_EDA_3.png" alt = "Boxplot" width="183" height="auto" >
								<h3>Grouping:</h3>
								<p>After running dimensionality reduction techniques on our NFA dataset, we used K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Grouping techniques to form unique groups of countries to later create models on. We decided to further explore clusters with 5 groups and 3 groupings for hierarchical analysis.</p>

								<h3>K-Means Clustering, 5 Groups</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Group 1: Brazil, India, Russia</li>

									<li>Group 5: United States of America</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Hierarchical Clustering, 3 Groups</h3>
								<ul>

Philippines, Guinea-Bissau, Timor-Leste, Eritrea, Zimbabwe, Rwanda, Saint Lucia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Tajikistan, Swaziland, Syrian Arab Republic, United Republic of Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Burkina Faso, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Viet Nam, Ethiopia, Yemen, Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, Sudan, South Sudan</li>
									<li>Group 2: Australia, Bahrain, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Kazakhstan, Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Mongolia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Turkmenistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Oman, United Arab Emirates, United States of America, Luxembourg</li>
									<li>Group 3: Austria, Bahamas, Barbados, Bhutan, Botswana, Belize, Bulgaria, Chile, Denmark, Belarus, Equatorial Guinea, Estonia, Fiji, Finland, France, French Guiana, French Polynesia, Germany, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Guadeloupe, Hungary, Croatia, Iran, Islamic, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Latvia, Lebanon, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Lithuania, Malaysia, Malta, Netherlands, Macedonia TFYR, Norway, Czech Republic, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovenia, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Suriname, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom Turkey, Ukraine, Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Belgium, Serbia, Montenegro, China</li>
								</ul>
								<p>After determining these clusters, we decided to go forth with creating time series, ensemble, and RNN models using these clusters, worldwide data, and geographical region data.</p>
